## My Process

### Built With

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**

### What I Learned

This project solidified my understanding of DOM manipulation, event listeners, and fundamental JavaScript operations. Implementing edge cases (like division by zero) provided additional insights into JavaScript error handling.

### Continued Development

Future improvements could include more complex mathematical functions, keyboard support, and a refined user interface for better user experience.
